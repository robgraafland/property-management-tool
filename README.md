# property-management-tool
Website package to manage properties for small landlords.

The website is build around two views, the landlord view and the tenant view. 

The landlord view is property-centric, providing an overview per property and alerting landlord if necessary.

The tenant view is home-centric, it first and foremost provides a method to pay rent, additionally there is an overview of the most important items surrounding their home.

Business question: Should this be focused on property managers instead?

I.e., Humming Homes meets Rental Property Manager
